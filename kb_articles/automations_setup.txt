Title: How to Configure Automations in Hiver

Hiver automations allow you to reduce manual effort by creating rules that trigger actions when certain conditions are met.

To configure automations:
1. Go to the Hiver Dashboard.
2. Navigate to Automations.
3. Click "Create Automation".
4. Select a trigger — for example: "When an email arrives", "When a tag is applied", or "When status changes".
5. Define conditions such as subject keywords, assignee, SLA status, customer domain, etc.
6. Add one or more actions — assign to user, apply a tag, update status, add note, etc.
7. Save and enable the automation.

Common issues:
- Automations won't run if they are disabled.
- Conflicting automations may cause unexpected behavior.
- Make sure conditions are not mutually exclusive.
