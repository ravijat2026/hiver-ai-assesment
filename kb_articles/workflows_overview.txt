Title: Understanding Hiver Workflows

Workflows control how conversations move across teams. You can define stages, assign owners, and automate transitions.

To edit a workflow:
1. Go to Settings → Workflows.
2. Open an existing workflow or create a new one.
3. Add workflow stages such as "New", "Pending", "Resolved".
4. Configure automation rules for stage transitions.

Editing a workflow may impact existing automations or tasks.
