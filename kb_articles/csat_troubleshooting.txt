Title: Why is CSAT Not Appearing?

If CSAT scores are not visible in Hiver Analytics, the following steps may help:

1. Ensure CSAT surveys are enabled for the shared mailbox.
2. Check that the conversation was marked as "Resolved". CSAT triggers only on resolution.
3. Verify that the email includes the CSAT snippet. Email signature apps sometimes remove it.
4. Confirm that the CSAT dashboard is not filtered by date or agent.
5. Check user permissions — only Admins and Managers can view Analytics.

If CSAT stopped appearing suddenly:
- Check recent changes to email templates
- Updates to the CSAT configuration
- Whether Gmail threading removed the CSAT snippet
